Skyfly

I imagined my app as a powerful tool to monitor and track flights and delays as well as show airport locations and information.
I also wanted it to be able to search up any plane and see every detail about it, i.e. when it was built, who owns it, what its on-time percentage is, etc.

I still plan to fully developing it that way, but as my Quarter 1 project I didn't have enough time to develop it as powerful as I want.

The features of the app are simple and straight-forward, but still quite powerful. You can simultaneously view all current flights in real time, and then click on each one to see the flight number, departure and arrival info, speed, elevation, and callsign.

I definitely plan to do the same with all the world airports, where you can view them all at once or search them separately, then they'll have a window with website and contact information.

I also plan to include all airlines and their contact information, and make everything searchable by airline, airport, flight number, or departure and arrival info.
